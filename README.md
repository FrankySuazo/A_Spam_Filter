# A_Spam_Filter
Ever received spam email, and wondered how they get through, when it's obvious, by just the title, that's fake?

It could be something simple; like they used a 3 instead of E, or, 1 instead of an I.

In this Spam Filter project, I used capture groups, positive lookaheads, negative lookaheads, and other techniques to match any text the user wants to 'filter out' and, not to mention, the most common 'catch phase' spam email mostly uses.

I used Regular expressions, often shortened to "regex" or "regexp", are patterns that help programmers match, search, and replace text. Regular expressions are powerful, but can be difficult to understand because they use so many special characters.
